<!-- In case of live server when we enter the URL and press enter browser makes request to the 
live server for rendering the particular HTML file then live server goes to the particular file 
location and sends back the particular HTML file for rendering and then browser 
parses that HTML file and as it will find more references like index.js in our case
it will tell browser to request these reference files from the live server
and when the browser will have all the files with it, it will create a DOM model -->

<!-- if we use <script src="index.js" defer></script>  "defer" attribute in script tag 
 then request for index.js file will be made by the browser but not rendered 
 firstly complete HTML file will be rendered then index.js file will be rendered
 but without using defer keyword the execution of index.html file will stop
 and it will load index.js file completely.-->
