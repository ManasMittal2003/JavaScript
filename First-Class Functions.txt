A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions 
in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function 
can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned 
by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

Assigning Function to a variable :

    const foo = () => {
    console.log("foobar");
    };
    foo(); // Invoke it using the variable

Passing Function as an arguement :

    function greet(sayhello, name){
        console.log(sayhello(), name);
    }
    function hellomsg(){
        return "Hello";
    }
    greet(hellomsg,"Manas");

When a function is passed to another function then the function passed is jnown as a Callback
function here in the above example hellomsg is a callback function

Returning a function :

    function sayHello() {
    return () => {
        console.log("Hello!");
    };
    }

Note: The functions which return a function or takes an function as arguement are known as
higher - order functions
