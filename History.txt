In early days when the websites used to be only static, any computaion which needs
to be done is done on the server. Example: if a website contains a calculator then it
needs to send request to the server there on the server that computation will be done
and then the server will respond with a new HTML page containing the result, this
process required a lot of time because of less internet connectivity at that time.

So, the founder of NETSCAPE browser gone to Brendon Eich and told to create a programming
language that can run on browsers and do these type of works on users machine to avoid
server calls.

Brendon Eich created JS in 10 days. Basically, it runs because of an engine in browser 
which executes the javascript codes.

Firstly JS was named as "Mocha" and then "LiveScript" and then finally it named as
"JavaScript".

Then later on when chrome was introduced it came with its own engine to run JS on browser
known as "V8 engine" which is more fast and optimised than other engines.

Later on "Ryan Dahl" took out the V8 engine from browser and setup a separate environment
which he named as "Nodejs" due to which JS became available to run on server side as well.
